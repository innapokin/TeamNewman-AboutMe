Fresh graduate from Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge with a Master in Computer Science. I am currently delving into the world of software testing. It is quite fascinating and interesting at the same time. Although I may be inexperienced, I am currently doing my badges with online courses in the role. I plan to finish the courses and get my ISTQB certificate as soon as I can while also getting familiar with the software I need to perform my testing duties. That is the current goal I plan to achieve. If you have any tips or advice please do drop me a message, I will greatly appreciate the gesture. I believe we can all help one another in some way, shape or form and that is how we move as a community.

Thank you for reading.
